A celebration of jpeg wealth ðŸŒ·

Unlike commonly believed, the tulip mania was not a mania, but rather a celebration of newfound wealth within a subset of society.

We are witnessing history repeat itself.

The tulips traits are historically accurate based on the discovery of ancient dutch knowledge from our dutch frens.

The 100 tulips are auction off over a 100 day period using a historically accurate flower auction mechanism.

Join the tulip revolution ðŸŒ·
